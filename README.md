Spam Classifier for SMS and Email Messages

Welcome to the Spam Classifier project! This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning model that classifies SMS and email messages as spam or not spam. The model is built using a dataset from Kaggle, cleaned and preprocessed, and evaluated using a web-based interface.

Overview
This project aims to classify messages as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques. The key steps involved are:

Dataset Acquisition: Using a dataset from Kaggle.
Data Cleaning: Applying various techniques to preprocess the data.
Feature Extraction: Utilizing TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
Model Building: Employing MultinomialNB (Naive Bayes) as the classifier due to its effectiveness.
Web Interface: Developing a web application (aap.py) to interact with the classifier and test its predictions.
Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-classifier.git
cd spam-classifier
Set Up a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Required Packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file includes necessary libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and flask.

Usage
Running the Classifier
Start the Web Application:

Run the following command to start the Flask web application:

bash
Copy code
python aap.py
Access the Web Interface:

Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the web interface where you can input SMS or email messages for classification.

Example Input
In the web interface, you can enter a message and click "Predict" to see whether the message is classified as spam or not spam.

Code Explanation
Data Cleaning: The data is preprocessed using techniques such as removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and removing stop words.
Feature Extraction: TfidfVectorizer is used to convert text messages into numerical feature vectors.
Model Training: MultinomialNB is trained on the preprocessed data and used for classification.
Web Application (aap.py): This Flask application provides a simple interface to interact with the model and test its predictions.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle. It contains SMS and email messages labeled as spam or not spam. The dataset can be found here.
